Cybersecurity Project
This project aims to demonstrate a cybersecurity mechanism that can protect a Windows 10 system from potential attacks, collect and store relevant data, and analyze logs for threat detection. The project involves the following components:

Victim (Windows 10): A Windows 10 system that is potentially the target of an attack. It is connected to enforcing rules and data collection mechanisms.
Enforcing Rules: A mechanism or set of protocols established to protect the Windows 10 system from potential threats.
LimaCharlie Web: A tool or platform that collects data from the Windows 10 system for further analysis.
Azure: Microsoft’s cloud computing service where logs are collected and stored for analysis.
Attacker C&C (Command and Control): An attacker’s system which is monitored by Elastic Siem Ubuntu for suspicious activities.
Elastic Siem Ubuntu: A security information and event management tool running on Ubuntu, used for analyzing logs and detecting potential security threats.
The diagram below shows the flow of information and interaction among the components:
